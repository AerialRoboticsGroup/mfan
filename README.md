# contrastive-forward-forward-algorithm (CFF) / MetaMorphic Forward Adaptation Network (MFAN)
The CFF model is tested in three phases:

* 01_1: (Do MNIST Classification) Prove feasibility and discrete data processing
* 01_2: (Do CIFAR Classification) Prove feasibility and discrete data processing
* 02: (Do Function Regression) Operating in the continuous realm
* 03: (Do Continous Data Stream tasks) Operating in a dynamic environment with evolving tasks

The detailed results, data, and analysis are shown in the thesis.
