Metamorphic Forward Adaptation Network (MFAN)
The MFAN model is tested in three phases:

* 01_1: (Do MNIST Classification) Prove feasibility and discrete data processing
* 01_2: (Do CIFAR Classification) Prove feasibility and discrete data processing on a more complex dataset
* 02: (Do Function Regression) Operating in the continuous realm
* 03: (Do Continuous Data Stream tasks) Operating in a dynamic environment with evolving tasks

For reproducibility, running the notebook in order would help re-generate the results.
Each subtest has its own isolated subsection and can run independently from other tests.

Detailed results, data, and analysis are shown in the corresponding paper.
